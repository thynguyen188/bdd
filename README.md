# BDD/TDD
Code Kata surrounding BDD/TDD focused on the code

## Useful features of BDD/Cucumber/Gherkin
     - Writing BDD tests in an omnipresent language, a language structured around the domain model and widely used by all team members comprising of developers, testers, BAs, and customers. 
     – Connecting technical with nontechnical members of a software team.
     – Allowing direct interaction with the developer’s code, but BDD tests are written in a language which can also be made out by business stakeholders.
     – Acceptance tests can be executed automatically, while it is performed manually by business stakeholders.
     
## Getting Started
  - Clone the repo to have a local copy `git clone ....`
  - From project root, run command `yarn` or `npm install` (this creates your dependencies)
  - Run command from the project root directory: `yarn test` (this should show the failing test)
  - Run watcher from the project root directory: `npm run watch` (this should show the failing test and rerun each time the files change)
  
## Next steps
  - Write bare, minimal code to get the tests to pass
  - Refactor code to production ready
  - Add more scenarios
  - Add more features
